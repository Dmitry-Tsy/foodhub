[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Running "expo doctor"
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Running 15 checks on your project...
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] 12/15 checks passed. 3 checks failed. Possible issues detected:
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Use the --verbose flag to see more details about passed checks.
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] 
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] ✖ Check dependencies for packages that should not be installed directly
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] The package "expo-modules-core" should not be installed directly in your project. You should instead use the exported API from the expo package.
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Advice:
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Remove these packages from your package.json.
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] 
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] ✖ Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, icon, userInterfaceStyle, splash, ios, android, plugins. 
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] 
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Advice:
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Add '/android' to your .gitignore file if you intend to use CNG / Prebuild. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/#usage-with-eas-build
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] 
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] ✖ Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR]   @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@2.2.0 - expected version: 1.21.0
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR]   expo-linear-gradient@15.0.7 - expected version: ~12.7.2
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR]   react-native-webview@13.16.0 - expected version: 13.6.4
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Your project may not work correctly until you install the correct versions of the packages.
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Found outdated dependencies
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Advice:
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Use 'npx expo install --check' to review and upgrade your dependencies.
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] To ignore specific packages, add them to "expo.install.exclude" in package.json. Learn more: https://expo.fyi/dependency-validation
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] 3 checks failed, indicating possible issues with the project.
